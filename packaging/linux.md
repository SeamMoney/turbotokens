# Linux release validation

Starting with v1.1.3, the release workflow builds native x64 and arm64 binaries
with musl, then rejects
any executable that requires a dynamic loader or shared library. The archive names
remain `turbotokens-linux-x64.tar.gz` and `turbotokens-linux-arm64.tar.gz`, so the
npm package, Homebrew formula, and shell installer can use the same asset lookup.

The v1.1.2 Linux archives require glibc 2.39. Changing the workflow does not change
those published archives. Each new release must pass the checks below before its
checksums are added to the install packages.

The [2026-09-08 validation run](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/actions/runs/34226344048)
passed static-linkage and container-report checks for both Linux architectures
at commit `55431b46`, covering all six architecture/distribution combinations.

`packaging/smoke-linux.py` runs each new binary in Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, and
Alpine 3.22 containers. It verifies the exact version, reads a synthetic Claude
log with a duplicate event, checks all four token categories, and compares the
complete JSON report across containers. Reports use embedded pricing with
`--offline`; the containers have no network access and run as an unprivileged
user. Their log fixture is mounted read-only.

Pull requests touching Rust or the release checks run the build matrix. A manual
run of the `release` workflow also builds and retains all six archives without
publishing a release. On a version-tag push, publication waits for every build
and validation step to pass. The tag must match the version in `rust/Cargo.toml`.

## Reproduce on Linux

Use an x64 or arm64 Ubuntu machine with Rust and Docker installed. The build
uses the machine's native architecture:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends musl-tools binutils
target="$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl"
rustup target add "$target"
export "CC_${target//-/_}=musl-gcc"
export "AR_${target//-/_}=ar"
upper_target="${target^^}"
export "CARGO_TARGET_${upper_target//-/_}_LINKER=musl-gcc"
export "CARGO_TARGET_${upper_target//-/_}_RUSTFLAGS=-C target-feature=+crt-static"
cargo build --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --locked --release --bin turbotokens \
  --features fetch-litellm-pricing --target "$target"
package_id="$(cargo pkgid --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --package turbotokens)"
version="${package_id##*#}"
version="${version##*@}"
python3 packaging/smoke-linux.py "rust/target/$target/release/turbotokens" "$version"
```

These tests cover libc compatibility and report behavior on the runner's Linux
kernel. They do not establish compatibility with every kernel or CPU. The npm
wrapper also needs a Node version that runs on the host distribution.

Rust documents [static C runtime selection](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes).
Native C dependencies use the compiler and archiver selected through
[cc's target-specific environment variables](https://docs.rs/cc/latest/cc/#external-configuration-via-environment-variables).
