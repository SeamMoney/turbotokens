**Fast usage reports, a live dashboard, and shareable stats for 18 AI coding agents.** Read the logs already on your machine, including Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, and more. No account or API key needed for local reports.

If turbotokens helps you, [star the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens) — it helps other developers find it.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g turbotokens
turbotokens
turbotokens live
```

Or run a report with `npx turbotokens`.

This package installs the native Rust binary for your OS and architecture, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and exposes the `turbotokens` command. Keep npm installation scripts enabled. macOS, Linux, and Windows have both arm64 and x64 release builds.

**Replacing ccusage in an app?** Use an explicit agent: `turbotokens claude daily --json` or `turbotokens codex daily --json`. Plain `turbotokens daily` combines agents and has a different JSON shape. This package exposes a CLI; it does not replace JavaScript imports. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/blob/main/docs/migrating-from-ccusage.md) for command mappings and a subprocess example.

```sh
turbotokens daily --last 7                  # Recent usage across detected agents
turbotokens claude daily --breakdown        # Claude model costs
turbotokens codex session                   # Codex usage by session
turbotokens daily --json                    # Structured output
turbotokens live --agent grok               # Follow Grok Build while it works
turbotokens live --agent codex              # Follow Codex while it works
turbotokens stream                         # JSON token events, one object per line
turbotokens heatmap --svg heatmap.svg       # Contribution graph
turbotokens wrapped --year 2026 --svg wrapped.svg
turbotokens doctor                         # Data discovery and diagnostics
```

Grok live mode and `stream` require **v1.1.3 or newer**. Check `turbotokens --version` after installing.

Live mode also supports budget webhooks, JSON events, and Prometheus metrics. See the [full usage guide](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/blob/main/docs/usage.md).

## Measured performance

On an M1 Max, turbotokens 1.1.0 completed a repeated Claude daily report over 3.63 GB of synthetic logs in **12.9 ms**, compared with **3.65 s for ccusage 20.0.20**. Five-run medians, native ARM64 binaries, warmed caches, six files, matching input/output/cache token counts. These are workload-specific results.

## Usage worth sharing

Heatmaps and yearly cards are direct SVG exports. Your exports may include project names and usage statistics.

## Data and costs

Reports read local agent logs. Costs are estimates and can differ from your bill. Pricing refreshes, subscription-limit queries, and configured webhooks may use the network; use `--offline` where supported for embedded or cached pricing. These features do not upload your log files.
