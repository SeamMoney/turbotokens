## Install

Choose your platform. Native downloads are available for **Apple Silicon / ARM64 and Intel / AMD x64**.

**Release status:** Native downloads and Homebrew install **v1.1.5**. npm currently installs **v1.1.2** while its package update awaits publication. Use the native Windows ZIP for the latest fixes.

### macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed:

```sh
brew install maxmoneycash/tap/turbotokens
```

For a standalone install, follow the [macOS instructions](docs/installation.md#macos). No Node.js runtime is needed.

### Windows

For **v1.1.5**, download the [Windows x64 ZIP](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/releases/latest/download/turbotokens-windows-x64.zip) or [Windows ARM64 ZIP](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/releases/latest/download/turbotokens-windows-arm64.zip). Extract it, open PowerShell in that folder, and run:

```powershell
.\turbotokens.exe doctor
.\turbotokens.exe claude daily --last 7
```

The [Windows guide](docs/installation.md#windows) explains checksums, PATH, and WSL. No Node.js runtime is needed.

With Node.js installed, npm currently provides **v1.1.2**. Run this in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
npm install -g turbotokens
turbotokens --version
```

### Linux

Run in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seammoney/turbotokens/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer selects x64 or ARM64 and prints the install location. If it uses `~/.local/bin`, add that directory to your PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

The v1.1.5 Linux downloads are static builds tested on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, and Alpine 3.22. See [Linux instructions](docs/installation.md#linux) for distro compatibility, persistent PATH setup, and pinned releases. No Node.js runtime is needed.

### Run your first report

These commands work on all three platforms after installation:

```text
turbotokens --version
turbotokens doctor
turbotokens
turbotokens claude daily --last 7
turbotokens codex daily
```

`doctor` finds your agents' logs. Plain `turbotokens` shows daily usage across
agents; name `claude` or `codex` to focus on one source.

You can also try **`npx turbotokens`** on any platform with Node.js. The npm package downloads and launches the native executable; keep npm installation scripts enabled. [All install and upgrade options →](docs/installation.md)

## Coming from ccusage?

Install alongside it, choose the same agent, and compare the fields your app reads:

```sh
# Claude-only JSON, suitable for a Claude usage integration
turbotokens claude daily --offline --json

# Codex-only JSON
turbotokens codex daily --offline --json
```

**Use an explicit agent when replacing a single-source report.** Plain `turbotokens daily` combines detected agents and has a different JSON shape. The npm package exposes a CLI; it does not replace older ccusage JavaScript imports.

The [migration guide](docs/migrating-from-ccusage.md) includes command mappings, a Node.js subprocess example, rollback advice, and an executable compatibility check. [Seventeen recorded cases](rust/bench/results/compatibility-claude.json) compare released native binaries on synthetic Claude histories, including token categories, filters, duplicates, and cached versus uncached JSON.

## Live dashboard

Grok live mode and `stream` require **v1.1.3 or newer**. Check the [release status](#install) before installing.

```sh
turbotokens live                    # Claude Code
turbotokens live --agent codex
turbotokens live --agent grok
```

<img src="assets/live-demo.gif?v=28ea241e0f51" alt="The turbotokens terminal dashboard updating token counts, estimated cost, burn rate, and active sessions as synthetic usage records arrive." width="100%">

Live mode polls every 100 ms by default. It shows new usage as the agent writes its logs. [Static preview](assets/live-dashboard.png) · [Recording source](demo/README.md)

For scripts and monitoring:

```sh
turbotokens stream --offline                 # NDJSON snapshot and usage events
turbotokens live --alert-cost 25              # Notify at $25 estimated spend
turbotokens live --serve 127.0.0.1:9090        # Local Prometheus endpoint
```

Budget alerts can call a webhook; they do not stop the coding agent. See [live options and payloads](docs/usage.md#live-mode), or add `turbotokens statusline` to your [Claude Code status line](docs/usage.md#claude-code-status-line).

## Benchmarks

**A cached Claude daily report took 12.9 ms on 3.63 GB of logs, versus 3.65 s for ccusage.** This is a measured repeat-report workload, with no daemon running.

<img src="assets/comparison-daily.png?v=d161a6f2d5d1" alt="Cached daily JSON report benchmark across 72 MB to 3.63 GB of synthetic Claude logs. Full measurements and reproduction commands are linked below." width="100%">

Measured September 6, 2026, on an Apple M1 Max with native ARM64 releases: turbotokens **1.1.0** and ccusage **20.0.20**. Five interleaved runs per size; median wall time includes JSON output. Pricing and caches were primed, and all four token categories matched on each run. This measures recorded usage counters, not text tokenization.

The cache is Claude-specific. First scans, changed files, other agents, and different machines take different paths. With 1,000 smaller files (72 MB total), the measured daily medians were 12.7 ms and 71.9 ms.

### Monthly reports: compared with both tools

<img src="assets/comparison-monthly.png?v=fe6de784eae5" alt="Monthly JSON report benchmark on 3.63 GB of synthetic Claude logs: turbotokens 1.54 seconds, tokscale 3.99 seconds, and ccusage 4.83 seconds. Lower is better." width="100%">

| Transcript size | turbotokens 1.1.0 | ccusage 20.0.20 | tokscale 4.15.1 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 72 MB | **38 ms** | 71 ms | 107 ms |
| 362 MB | **147 ms** | 273 ms | 340 ms |
| 725 MB | **263 ms** | 539 ms | 751 ms |
| 1.81 GB | **622 ms** | 1,230 ms | 1,859 ms |
| 3.63 GB | **1.54 s** | 4.83 s | 3.99 s |

**Measured September 6, 2026, on an Apple M1 Max.** Five runs per tool and size, interleaved; median process wall time includes JSON output. Each dataset contains six synthetic files. The largest contains usage counters totaling 50 billion tokens; it is **3.63 GB of transcript data**, not 50 billion tokens of text being tokenized. Monthly reporting uses a different aggregation path from the cached daily fast path.

Different file counts, agent formats, machines, and background load can change the result. Costs can differ with pricing sources, so the cross-tool check compares token categories, not estimated dollars. Tokscale has no equivalent `daily` report command; it is included in the matching monthly comparison.

**[Raw samples, binary hashes, and reproduction commands →](rust/bench/README.md)**

<details>
<summary>What about the first scan?</summary>

In a separate cache-on/cache-off test, turbotokens scanned the 3.63 GB history in **1.10 s with its parse cache disabled**, then returned the cached daily report in **9 ms**. Both used a warmed OS file cache and offline pricing. Every cached and uncached JSON result was byte-identical.

<img src="assets/scaling-chart.png?v=14d98ff6804c" alt="turbotokens daily report timing with its parse cache enabled and disabled across five transcript sizes" width="100%">

See the [cache benchmark](rust/bench/README.md#cache-enabled-versus-disabled) for the separate run and its raw samples.

## Data, costs, and privacy

- **Your logs stay local.** Reports aggregate usage records already on your machine. They need no transcript upload or turbotokens account.
- **Costs are estimates.** Model prices and recorded usage can differ from a provider bill or subscription allowance. Missing local logs cannot be reconstructed.
- **Network access depends on the feature.** Use `--offline` where supported for embedded or cached pricing. Installation, refreshed pricing, subscription `limits`, and configured webhooks contact their respective services.

An empty or surprising report starts with `turbotokens doctor`. Check the source, date range, timezone, and [adapter's log locations](rust/adapters/README.md). For a counting issue, share a small sanitized fixture in a [bug report](https://github.com/seammoney/turbotokens/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

cd turbotokens/rust
cargo build --release --bin turbotokens --features fetch-litellm-pricing
cargo test --workspace --features fetch-litellm-pricing

The repository pins its Rust toolchain. Builds embed a pricing snapshot; set `TURBOTOKENS_PRICING_JSON_PATH` to use a local LiteLLM pricing file. Parsing and cache changes must preserve report JSON, with fixtures and measured performance checks.
